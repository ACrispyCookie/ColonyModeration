# ColonyModeration
### NOTE: This plugin is being recoded!

ColonyModeration was my first project and although it has some pretty unique features it is the least optimised plugin I've coded. The most remarkable features are:

  - One-click bans/mutes (Automatic duration calculation)
  - Fully custom punishments
  - Staff rating system based their performance
  - Punish multiple players at once
  - Rollback punishments
  - Automatic kick on ban evading accounts
  - Report system
  - Chat managing system
  - User feedback for staff members using Book GUI
  - Two factor authentication for staff on discord
  - Simpler ban/mute system for the discord server
  - Minecraft & Discord user link
  - Automatic role assignment on discord based on in-game rank
